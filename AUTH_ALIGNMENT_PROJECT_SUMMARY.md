# Aroosi Mobile Authentication Alignment - Project Summary

## Project Overview

This project aligned the authentication system in the Aroosi Mobile application with the web application by migrating from a custom cookie-session based authentication system to Clerk-based authentication.

## Completed Work

### 1. New Authentication System Implementation
- Created `contexts/ClerkAuthContext.tsx` implementing Clerk-based authentication
- Mirrored the web project's `ClerkAuthProvider.tsx` functionality
- Included all methods and properties from the web version

### 2. Application Entry Point Updates
- Modified `App.tsx` to use `ClerkProvider` and `ClerkAuthProvider`
- Added environment variable check for Clerk publishable key
- Updated provider imports to use the new Clerk-based system

### 3. Authentication Screen Updates
- Updated `LoginScreen.tsx` to use `useClerkAuth`
- Updated `SignUpScreen.tsx` to use `useClerkAuth`
- Updated `ForgotPasswordScreen.tsx` to use `useClerkAuth`
- Updated `ResetPasswordScreen.tsx` to use `useClerkAuth`

### 4. Navigation System Updates
- Updated `RootNavigator.tsx` to use `useClerkAuth`

### 5. Social Authentication Updates
- Updated `SocialAuthButtons.tsx` to use Clerk's OAuth flow directly

### 6. Context Export Updates
- Updated `contexts/index.ts` to export `ClerkAuthProvider` instead of `AuthProvider`

### 7. Documentation and Tooling
- Created comprehensive documentation of the alignment process
- Created update scripts and guides for remaining work
- Created backup of the old authentication system

8. `MANUAL_UPDATE_GUIDE.md` - Guide for manually updating remaining files
9. `scripts/updateAuth.sh` - Script to help automate remaining updates
10. `contexts/AuthContext.tsx.backup` - Backup of the old AuthContext file

## Key Files Modified

1. `App.tsx` - Updated to use ClerkProvider and ClerkAuthProvider
2. `src/screens/auth/LoginScreen.tsx` - Updated to use useClerkAuth
3. `src/screens/auth/SignUpScreen.tsx` - Updated to use useClerkAuth
4. `src/screens/auth/ForgotPasswordScreen.tsx` - Updated to use useClerkAuth
5. `src/screens/auth/ResetPasswordScreen.tsx` - Updated to use useClerkAuth
6. `src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx` - Updated to use useClerkAuth
7. `components/auth/SocialAuthButtons.tsx` - Updated to use Clerk's OAuth flow
8. `contexts/index.ts` - Updated exports to use ClerkAuthProvider
9. `__tests__/ClerkAuthContext.test.ts` - Updated test file for the new authentication context

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency**: Unified authentication system across web and mobile platforms
2. **Security**: Leveraging Clerk's enterprise-grade authentication features
3. **Maintainability**: Reduced code duplication and simplified authentication logic
4. **Scalability**: Better integration with third-party services that support Clerk
5. **User Experience**: Enhanced authentication flows including social login and passwordless options

## Remaining Work

See `AUTH_ALIGNMENT_CHECKLIST.md` and `AUTH_ALIGNMENT_FINAL_SUMMARY.md` for a complete list of remaining tasks, including:

1. Updating all hooks and components that still reference the old authentication system
2. Updating API service files to work with Clerk's authentication system
3. Updating tests to use the new authentication system
4. Removing the old authentication system files after all references are updated
5. Comprehensive testing of all authentication flows and related functionality

## Next Steps

1. Review and update all remaining files listed in the checklist
2. Run the automated update script to assist with bulk updates
3. Manually review and correct any issues introduced by the automated updates
4. Update API service files to work with Clerk's authentication system
5. Update and run all tests to ensure functionality
6. Perform comprehensive testing of all authentication flows
7. Remove the old authentication system files after confirming all references are updated
8. Update documentation to reflect the new authentication system
9. Communicate changes to the development team

## Environment Variables

The mobile app now requires the following environment variable:
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Clerk publishable key

## Testing Requirements

After completing all updates, thoroughly test:
1. Email/password sign in
2. Email/password sign up
3. Google OAuth sign in
4. Password reset flow
5. Sign out functionality
6. Session persistence across app restarts
7. All API endpoints that require authentication
8. All hooks and components that depend on authentication
9. All messaging functionality
10. All subscription-related functionality

This alignment project represents a significant step forward in the Aroosi Mobile application's architecture, bringing it in line with modern authentication best practices and ensuring consistency with the web platform.
