# Aroosi Mobile Authentication Alignment - Final Summary

## Completed Work

### 1. New Clerk Authentication System
- Created `ClerkAuthContext.tsx` which implements Clerk-based authentication
- Mirrors the functionality of the web project's `ClerkAuthProvider.tsx`
- Includes all the same methods and properties as the web version

### 2. Updated Application Entry Point
- Modified `App.tsx` to use `ClerkProvider` and `ClerkAuthProvider`
- Added environment variable check for Clerk publishable key
- Updated provider imports to use the new Clerk-based system

### 3. Updated Authentication Screens
- Modified `LoginScreen.tsx` to use `useClerkAuth` instead of `useAuth`
- Modified `SignUpScreen.tsx` to use `useClerkAuth` instead of `useAuth`
- Modified `ForgotPasswordScreen.tsx` to use `useClerkAuth` instead of `useAuth`
- Modified `ResetPasswordScreen.tsx` to use `useClerkAuth` instead of `useAuth`

### 4. Updated Navigation
- Modified `RootNavigator.tsx` to use `useClerkAuth` instead of `useAuth`

### 5. Updated Social Authentication
- Modified `SocialAuthButtons.tsx` to use Clerk's OAuth flow directly

### 6. Updated Context Exports
- Modified `contexts/index.ts` to export `ClerkAuthProvider` instead of `AuthProvider`

## Remaining Work

### 1. Update Hooks and Components
There are still many hooks and components that import and use the old `AuthContext`:
- `components/onboarding/OnboardingGuard.tsx`
- `hooks/useContact.ts`
- `hooks/useImageUpload.ts`
- `hooks/useInAppPurchase.ts`
- `hooks/useInterests.ts`
- `hooks/useMessageSync.ts`
- `hooks/useMessagingApi.ts`
- `hooks/useMessagingSecurity.ts`
- `hooks/useOfflineMessaging.ts`
- `hooks/useOneSignal.ts`
- `hooks/useOptimizedRealtime.ts`
- `hooks/usePhotoManagement.ts`
- `hooks/useRealtime.ts`
- `hooks/useRealtimeMessaging.ts`
- `hooks/useSubscription.ts`
- `src/providers/NotificationProvider.tsx`
- `src/screens/main/ChatScreen.tsx`
- `src/screens/main/ConversationListScreen.tsx`
- `src/screens/main/EditProfileScreen.tsx`
- `src/screens/main/MatchesScreen.tsx`
- `src/screens/main/ProfileDetailScreen.tsx`
- `src/screens/main/ProfileScreen.tsx`
- `src/screens/main/SearchScreen.tsx`
- `src/screens/main/SubscriptionScreen.tsx`
- `src/screens/onboarding/ProfileSetupScreen.tsx`
- `src/screens/onboarding/WelcomeScreen.tsx`
- `src/screens/settings/SettingsScreen.tsx`
- `utils/enhancedApiClient.ts`
- `utils/unifiedMessagingApi.ts`

All of these files need to be updated to:
1. Import `useClerkAuth` instead of `useAuth` from `AuthContext`
2. Use the new authentication methods and properties provided by `useClerkAuth`

### 2. Update API Service Files
The API service files need to be updated to work with Clerk's authentication system:
- `services/auth.ts`
- `services/http.ts`
- Any other service files that make API calls

These files currently use a custom cookie-based authentication system and need to be updated to work with Clerk's token-based system.

### 3. Update Tests
Several test files still reference the old authentication system:
- `__tests__/auth.test.ts`
- `__tests__/integration/finalValidation.test.ts`
- `__tests__/integration/userJourney.test.ts`
- `__tests__/security.test.ts`

These tests need to be updated to use the new Clerk-based authentication system.

### 4. Cleanup
- Remove the old `AuthContext.tsx` file once all references have been updated
- Remove any unused code or dependencies
- Update package.json if any dependencies are no longer needed

### 5. Documentation
- Update any documentation that references the old authentication system
- Ensure all team members are aware of the changes
- Update any setup guides or README files

## Environment Variables
The mobile app now requires the following environment variable:
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Clerk publishable key

## Testing
After completing all the remaining work, thoroughly test:
1. Email/password sign in
2. Email/password sign up
3. Google OAuth sign in
4. Password reset flow
5. Sign out functionality
6. Session persistence across app restarts
7. All API endpoints that require authentication
8. All hooks and components that depend on authentication
9. All messaging functionality
10. All subscription-related functionality

## Benefits of the Alignment
1. Consistent authentication system across web and mobile platforms
2. Better security with Clerk's enterprise-grade authentication
3. Improved user experience with features like social login and passwordless authentication
4. Reduced maintenance overhead with a single authentication system
5. Better integration with third-party services that support Clerk
